# algorithmpractice

Includes:
Rotate matrix
Merge Sort
Quick Sort





Given two strings a and b find all permutations of a within b 





Advice from Ash: 

don't fight the interviewer 
ask him to rephrase 

be careful of trial and error. 
write some test code instead of writing over and over 


pseudo code, write out the process! 

if you can brute force something in 5 minutes, you can do that and tell them you can do the optimal. even you don't have the optimal, you still have something which is better than nothing. 

make sure you practice mergesort and quicksort. 

normally no built in methods. 


watch these. great refresher. 
1) (1 hour) javascript concepts:

the interviewer will only get upset if you act as you know but don't. be honest. show them you're enthusiastic about learning. be patient. 

even if you don't finish the challenge, do as much and clean if you can. 



30 different algorithms.
2) (3 hours)(5 problems) coding challenges:

try first. don't spend too much time if stuck. in that case, study the answer. 

3) (1-2 hours)(briefly) data structures:
